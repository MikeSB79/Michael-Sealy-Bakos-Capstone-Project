# Michael Sealy-Bakos Capstone Project

This project delivers a fully designed, operational multi-tier IT support system deployed in Microsoft Azure. 
It simulates a secure enterprise network capable of handling customer repair requests, technician workflows, file management, and controlled external access, showcasing practical cloud architecture, security practices, and system integration.

The environment features segmented virtual networks with a reverse proxy, web servers hosting customer and technician portals, a secure file server, and a dedicated jump host for administration. 
All virtual machines were configured with automated scripts to ensure consistent deployment, and monitoring/logging tools were integrated for visibility and operational oversight.
